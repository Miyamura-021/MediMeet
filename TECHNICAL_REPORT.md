### **Frontend Developer - Key Questions to Prepare For:**

#### **Q: What technologies did you use for the frontend?**
**Answer:** "I used React.js as the main framework with Vite as the build tool for fast development. For styling, I implemented Tailwind CSS to create a responsive, mobile-first design. The application uses React Router for navigation and React Hooks for state management."

#### **Q: How did you handle responsive design?**
**Answer:** "I implemented a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS utility classes. The design automatically adapts to different screen sizes - mobile, tablet, and desktop. I used Flexbox and Grid layouts along with responsive breakpoints to ensure the interface works perfectly on all devices."

#### **Q: How does the frontend communicate with the backend?**
**Answer:** "The frontend uses the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to our Node.js backend. We have specific API endpoints for different operations like user authentication, doctor listings, and booking management. The frontend sends data in JSON format and receives responses that update the UI accordingly."

## ⚙️ **Backend Architecture & Technologies**

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js for API development
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Handling:** Multer for image uploads
- **Validation:** Built-in validation and sanitization

### **API Structure:**
```
Backend API Endpoints:
├── Authentication
│   ├── POST /api/auth/login          # User login
│   ├── POST /api/auth/signup        # User registration
│   └── POST /api/auth/doctor-signup # Doctor registration
├── Users
│   ├── GET /api/users/profile        # Get user profile
│   └── PUT /api/users/profile        # Update user profile
├── Doctors
│   ├── GET /api/doctors             # List all doctors
│   ├── GET /api/doctors/:id         # Get specific doctor
│   ├── POST /api/doctors            # Add new doctor
│   └── PUT /api/doctors/:id         # Update doctor
├── Bookings
│   ├── POST /api/bookings           # Create booking
│   ├── GET /api/bookings            # Get user bookings
│   └── PUT /api/bookings/:id        # Update booking status
└── Admin
    ├── GET /api/admin/bookings      # Get all bookings
    └── PUT /api/admin/bookings/:id  # Admin booking management
```

### **Backend Developer - Key Questions to Prepare For:**

#### **Q: What is an API and how did you implement it?**
**Answer:** "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In our project, I created RESTful APIs using Express.js that serve as the bridge between the frontend and database. The frontend sends requests to these API endpoints, and the backend processes the business logic and database operations before sending back responses."

#### **Q: How did you handle user authentication?**
**Answer:** "I implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. When users log in, the backend validates their credentials against the database, then generates a unique token. This token is sent back to the frontend and stored locally. For subsequent requests, the frontend includes this token in the request headers, allowing the backend to verify the user's identity and authorize their actions."

#### **Q: What security measures did you implement?**
**Answer:** "I implemented several security measures: password hashing using bcrypt to protect user passwords, input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks, JWT token verification for secure authentication, and file upload validation to ensure only safe image files are accepted."

## 🗄️ **Database Architecture & Technologies**

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL document database)
- **ODM:** Mongoose for schema modeling and validation
- **Connection:** MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting
- **Data Structure:** Document-based collections with references

### **Database Schema Design:**
```
Database Collections:

1. Users Collection:
   - _id: ObjectId
   - name: String
   - email: String (unique)
   - password: String (hashed)
   - role: String (patient/doctor/admin)
   - phone: String
   - createdAt: Date

2. Doctors Collection:
   - _id: ObjectId
   - userId: ObjectId (reference to Users)
   - specialty: String
   - experience: Number
   - photo: String (file path)
   - isFeatured: Boolean
   - rating: Number
   - totalPatients: Number

3. Bookings Collection:
   - _id: ObjectId
   - patientId: ObjectId (reference to Users)
   - doctorId: ObjectId (reference to Doctors)
   - appointmentDate: Date
   - timeSlot: String
   - reason: String
   - status: String (pending/accepted/rejected)
   - createdAt: Date

4. Reviews Collection:
   - _id: ObjectId
   - patientId: ObjectId (reference to Users)
   - doctorId: ObjectId (reference to Doctors)
   - rating: Number
   - comment: String
   - createdAt: Date
```

### **Database Developer - Key Questions to Prepare For:**

#### **Q: Why did you choose MongoDB over other databases?**
**Answer:** "I chose MongoDB because it's a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This makes it perfect for our medical booking system where we have different types of data (users, doctors, bookings) that don't fit perfectly into rigid table structures. MongoDB also provides excellent scalability and is well-suited for web applications with changing requirements."

#### **Q: How did you handle relationships between different collections?**
**Answer:** "I used MongoDB references (ObjectIds) to create relationships between collections. For example, when a patient books an appointment, the booking document contains references to both the patient's user ID and the doctor's ID. This allows us to efficiently query related data while maintaining data integrity and avoiding duplication."

#### **Q: What is Mongoose and how did you use it?**
**Answer:** "Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a way to define schemas for our data, including validation rules, default values, and methods. I used Mongoose to create structured schemas for Users, Doctors, Bookings, and Reviews, ensuring data consistency and providing built-in validation for all database operations."

## 🔄 **Data Flow & Integration**

### **Complete User Journey Example:**

#### **1. Patient Books Appointment:**
```
Frontend → Backend → Database
1. User fills booking form (Frontend)
2. Form data sent to POST /api/bookings (Backend)
3. Backend validates data and creates booking (Database)
4. Success response sent back to Frontend
5. UI updates to show confirmation
```

#### **2. Doctor Views Bookings:**
```
Database → Backend → Frontend
1. Doctor requests their bookings (Frontend)
2. GET /api/bookings?doctorId=X (Backend)
3. Backend queries database for doctor's bookings (Database)
4. Booking data returned to Frontend
5. UI displays list of pending appointments
```
